\section*{Characters}
\subsection*{Player Characters}
Player characters have several core statistics that are involved in combat. 
These include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Health
\item Mana
\item Action Points 
\end{itemize}
The first is a statistic that describes the character's health, and 
ability to continue in the fight. If this statistic drops to zero, the 
character can no longer fight. This statistic is usually called health-points,
abbreviated to hp. I believe Lance mentioned calling it ``Will to Live'', or 
``Will to Go On'', which I think fits nicely with our depressing office 
setting.

The next is a representation of the character's energy to perform special 
actions, like big, fancy attacks. I believe Mason suggested calling this 
statistic ``caffeine''. Once again, this fits nicely into the setting. 

Lastly, action points are a measure of how many actions a character can take
in a round of combat. A player can break up their action points into several 
actions, or use most of them for a single more powerful action.  

\section*{Non-Player Characters}
Non-Player character have health, mana, and action points like player 
characters, but they will also have some personality statistics. These may
include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Friendliness
\item Irritability 
\item Immune System 
\end{itemize}
Friendliness will determine how much reputation increasing actions affect a
certain NPC. Irritability can influence how much reputation decreasing actions 
affect an NPC. Immune system can determine whether an NPC is in the office, 
if we choose to make this a feature. 

\section*{Items}
\subsection*{Weapons}
Weapons all have three statistics which are 
\begin{itemize}
\item Base Power
\item Accuracy 
\item Chance to Critical Hit
\end{itemize}
Weapons also give access to or upgrade certain types of attacks. An office
item, for example, may improve a player's "Compliment" ability, and an alien
ray gun may give them access to the "Ranged" type of physical attack.
\subsection*{Clothing}
Clothing and accessories modify a player's base statistics, and the statistics 
of their weapons. Professional clothing generally modifies the statistics which
are most used in verbal combat. Firewalls modify the statistics most often used
in cyberspace levels (such as by reducing the damage of virtul attacks). Armor 
modifies the statistics used in space station levels for physical combat.

\subsection*{Consumables}
Consumable items include items like snack, drinks, and medicine. Consumables 
can give temporary buffs, or instant effects, like restoring health. 

\section*{Attack Types}
There will be three types of attacks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Verbal
\item Virtual 
\item Physical
\end{itemize}

Verbal attacks will be used in office levels, for verbal sparring with coworker NPCS.
Virtual attacks will be used in cyberspace levels, for combat with viruses and 
security systems. Physical attacks will be used in space station levels, for physical
combat with aliens. 

\subsection*{Verbal}
There will be several types of verbal attacks which include 
\begin{itemize}
\item Compliment 
\item Insult 
\item Small Talk 
\item Technical 
\end{itemize}
All of these attack types can affect a character's accuracy, will to go on, 
health, and so on. Characters will be more susceptible or less susceptible
 to certain attack types based on their equipment. 
 We could have a single technical type, or many like accounting and IT. 
 
 Players will generally have access to base versions of the first three verbal
 attacks, but the weapon they are holding may give them better versions of these,
 and may provide access to a technical attack. 
 
 
 
  \subsection*{Virtual}

There will be three types of virtual attacks. These are
\begin{itemize}
\item Hack
\item Misdirect
\item Spoof ID
\end{itemize}
  In the cyberspace levels, players will start with a basic firewall, which
  reduces the amount of damage they take from virtual attacks, and a basic 
  antivirus program, which has a base damage, accuacy, and chance to critical
  hit. Improved antivirus programs will allow access to upgraded versions
  of all three virtual attack types.
  
  
  
  
    \subsection*{Physical}
 There will be two types of physical attacks. These are 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Bludgeoning 
 \item Ranged
 \end{itemize}
 Physical attacks will be used against aliens, but not against humans.
 Players will have access to basic Bludgeoning attacks, but holding a 
 weapon may give the player access to Ranged attacks, or more powerful
 Blugeoning attacks.
